[.lead]
Using configuration analysis insights and recommendations, leverage workload factory to implement best practices for your FSx for ONTAP file systems. You can easily review the well-architected status, learn about issues with your configurations, take action to improve the architecture of any systems that aren't optimized for reliability, security, efficiency, performance, and cost.

You can also dismiss the analysis of specific storage configurations that don't apply to your storage environment to avoid unnecessary alerts and inaccurate optimization results.

.About this task
Workload factory analyzes Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system deployment configurations daily. The daily analysis provides the well-architected status, and insights and recommendations with options to automatically fix configuration issues so that your file system meets best practices. 

You have options to review the recommendations for configuration issues with your file systems and fix the issues from the storage inventory within the workload factory console. 

Because requirements for storage configurations vary, you can dismiss the analysis of specific configurations that don't apply to your storage environment. This helps you avoid unnecessary alerts and inaccurate optimization results. When a specific configuration analysis is dismissed, the configuration isn't included in the total optimization score.

What is analyzed::
Workload factory analyzes the well-architected status of the following configurations for FSx for ONTAP file systems:  

* SSD capacity threshold
* Data tiering
* Scheduled local snapshots
* FSx for ONTAP backups
* Remote data replication 
* Storage efficiencies
* Automatic capacity management
* NetApp Autonomous Ransomware Protection with AI (ARP/AI)
* Volume file capacity threshold
* Long-term retention data reliability

.Before you begin
* You must have credentials with _read-only_ or _read/write_ permissions. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/add-credentials.html[Learn how to grant permissions in your AWS account^].
* Make sure you review each recommendation carefully before selecting to fix a setting or configuration. 

== Fix a configuration issue
You can fix configuration issues for an FSx for ONTAP file system or for selected volumes in a file system. You can select one or more configurations to fix.

NOTE: The remediation process may cause instance downtimes or service interruptions. Make sure you review the recommendation carefully before you choose to fix a configuration issue.

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. In the Storage tile, select *Go to Storage inventory*.
. In the *FSx for ONTAP* tab, navigate to the *Well-architected status* column and select the issues for the file system to fix. 
. In the well-architected dashboard for the file system, filter configuration issues by categories, subcategories, status, severity, and tags.  
. Select the dropdown arrow to view the recommendation for any configuration. Make sure you review the recommendation carefully. 
+ 
The recommendation explains best practices and potential pitfalls of unoptimized configurations.
. Select to *Fix*.
+
When *View and fix* is an option, select the impacted volumes to fix. 
. Review the summary and action items that appear in the dialog to learn what will happen if you choose to fix the issue. Some operations may cause instance downtimes or service interruptions. 
. Select *Continue* to fix the configuration issue. 

.Result
The process to fix the issue initiates. Select the account settings menu and then select *Tracker* to view the status of the operation.

== Dismiss a configuration analysis
Dismiss to stop a configuration analysis indefinitely for an FSx for ONTAP file system or for selected volumes in a file system. You can restart the analysis when needed.
