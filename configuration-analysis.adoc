BlueXP workload factory analyzes Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system configurations regularly to determine if any there are any issues. When issues are found, workload factory shows you what the issues are and explains what needs to change to ensure your file system storage achieves peak performance, cost efficiency, and compliance with best practices. 

Key capabilities include: 

* Daily configuration analysis
* Automatic best practice validations
* Proactive observability
* Insights to action
* AWS Well-Architected Framework advisor

== Well-architected status
In the workload factory console at the file-system level, well-architected status is listed for all FSx for ONTAP file systems. Well-architected statuses are categorized as "issues", "not analyzed", or "well-architected". Selecting the well-architected status redirects you to the well-architected status tab within the file system where you can find the well-architected score, configuration categories, all configurations for the file system.

Well-architected score::: The score includes all currently analyzed configurations and appears as a percentage. A 25% score means that 25% of the file system configurations are well-architected. 

Configuration categories::: The file system configurations are organized into categories aligned with the following five pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

* _Reliability_: Ensures that workloads perform their intended functions correctly and consistently, even when there are disruptions. An example configuration is FSx for ONTAP backups.
* _Security_: Emphasizes protecting data, systems, and assets through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.
* _Operational excellence_: Focuses on delivering the most optimal architecture and business value.
* _Cost optimization_: Aims to deliver business value while minimizing costs.
* _Performance efficiency_: Focuses on using resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain optimal performance as demands change.
