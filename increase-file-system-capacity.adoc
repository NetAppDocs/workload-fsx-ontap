= Adjust file system capacity in workload factory

[.lead]
Manually adjust the solid-state drive (SSD) storage capacity of an FSx for ONTAP file system to meet the needs of your project-based workloads with varying active working sets.

Increase the SSD storage capacity of an FSx for ONTAP file system when the amount of used SSD storage capacity exceeds a threshold that you specify or decrease the SSD storage capacity when working sets are inactive to improve cost efficiency.  

Alternatively, you can link:enable-auto-capacity-management.html[enable the automatic capacity management feature] so workload factory manages file system capacity for you. 

.About this task
Adjusting file system capacity impacts IOPS for your FSx for ONTAP file system. 

When you automatically link:provision-iops.html[provision IOPS] for a file system, IOPS increases or decreases by 3 IOPS with every 1 GiB increase or decrease in SSD capacity. 

When you link:provision-iops.html[provision IOPS] manually, you might need to increase your IOPS allocation to support the increased file system capacity. 

For SSD storage capacity limits, refer to link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/limits.html[Quotas^] in AWS FSx for NetApp ONTAP documentation. 

.Before you begin
To adjust capacity for a file system, you must first link:enable-auto-capacity-management.html[disable automatic capacity management]. 

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. In Storage, select *Go to Storage inventory*. 
. From the Dashboard, select *Adjust SSD capacity*. 
. Select the file system you want to adjust capacity for and then select *Continue*.
+
*Potential savings* is the recommendation for decreasing capacity.
. In the Adjust SSD capacity dialog, enter a number for *Provisioned capacity*. 
. Select the unit for the provisioned capacity.
. Select *Apply*.
