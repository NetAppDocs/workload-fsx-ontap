.Option 1

[.lead]
Using Workload Factory, you can get started with Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP in just a few steps. 

Workload Factory offers three different operation modes depending on the level of trust you have with using Workload Factory to manage your database workloads. 

Each mode has its own requirements for getting started.

* _Basic_ mode
+
In Basic mode, you can copy an empty template which you can complete outside of Workload Factory using the AWS CloudFormation console. You can also use the storage calculator to compare the costs of managing databases in AWS EBS, EFS and Windows File Server with FSx for ONTAP. AWS credentials and permissions aren't required.

* _Read_ mode
+
In read mode, you'll need some read-only permissions in AWS CloudFormation.
+
To use a ready-to-execute template that you fill out in Workload Factory for execution with AWS CloudFormation, you'll need AWS account credentials with some read-only permissions.  

* _Automate_ mode
+
In automate mode, you'll need AWS credentials, AWS CloudFormation permissions, and AWS Systems Manager Session Manager (SSM) connectivity.
+
To deploy and manage your workload resources within Workload Factory, you must have:
+
** AWS account credentials 
** AWS CloudFormation permissions 
** A deployed Amazon EC2 instance with an installed AWS Systems Manager Agent. The SSM Agent gives Workload Factory access to database host machines for installing, patching, or fetching data.
