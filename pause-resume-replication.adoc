= Pause and resume a replication relationship in BlueXP workload factory
:icons: font

[.lead]
Pause a replication relationship to stop scheduled replication updates from the source volume to the target volume. The target volume transitions from read-only to read-write. Both volumes continue to share the latest replication snapshot as a new baseline for later resynchronization.

.About this task
When paused, the replication relationship between source and target volume continues to exist. Data transfers pause and the volumes become independent. To re-enable the transfer of changes from source volume to destination volume, resume the replication. 

When you resume a replication, all the changes to the target volume are undone and BlueXP workload factory re-enables the replication. The target volume transitions from read-write to read-only, and receives updates from the source volume at the scheduled replication interval again. When you resume a replication relationship, the target volume reverts back to the latest initial replication snapshot, at which point, the volume replication process starts over.

.Before you begin
If you pause when a transfer is in progress, the transfer is not affected, and the relationship becomes "Quiescing" until the transfer completes. If the current transfer aborts, it is now a future transfer and will not restart.

== Pause a replication relationship

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. In Storage, select *Go to storage inventory*. 
. In the *FSx for ONTAP* tab, select the three-dot menu of the file system to update and then select *Manage*.  
. From the file system overview, select the *Replication relationships* tab. 
. In the Replication relationships tab, select the three-dot menu of the replication relationship to pause. 
. Select *Pause (Quiesce)*. 
. In the *Quiesce relationship* dialog, select *Quiesce*. 

.Result
The relationship pauses and its status shows as "Paused". 

== Resume a paused replication relationship
When you resume a replication relationship, any changes to the destination volume while the replication was stopped are deleted.

NOTE: Any data written to the original source volume between the last data replication and the time that the source volume is disabled is not preserved.

. From the file system overview, select the *Replication relationships* tab. 
. In the Replication relationships tab, select the three-dot menu of the replication relationship to resume. 
. Select *Resume*. 
. In the Resume relationship dialog, select *Resume*. 

.Result
The relationship resumes and its status shows as "Replicated".
