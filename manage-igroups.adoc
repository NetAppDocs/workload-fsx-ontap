From the NetApp Workload Factory console, you can manage the igroups for your FSx for ONTAP file systems. Management tasks include viewing igroup details, managing client access, and deleting igroups.

.About this task
Igroups, or initiator groups, are collections of host initiators that can access block devices in a SAN environment.

You can manage igroups for FSx for ONTAP file systems that use the iSCSI protocol.

.Before you begin
* You must associate a link to manage block devices. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-fsx-ontap/create-link.html[Learn how to associate an existing link or to create and associate a new link]. After you associate the link, return to this operation.
* You must have an existing block device to view and manage.
