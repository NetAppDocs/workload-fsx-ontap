Create a manual snapshot of an FSx for ONTAP volume in BlueXP workload factory. Snapshots are point-in-time versions of your volume's content.

Snapshots are resources of volumes and are instant captures of your data that consume space only for modified data. Because data changes over time, snapshots usually consume more space as they get older. 

FSx for ONTAP volumes use just-in-time copy-on-write so that any unmodified files in snapshots don't consume any of the volume's capacity.

NOTE: Snapshots aren't copies of your data. If you want to make copies of your data, consider using the FSx for ONTAP backups or volume replication features.
