Discover and view _cache_ volumes that are associated with cache relationships without leaving the NetApp Workload Factory console. Cache relationships are also known as ONTAP FlexCache relationships. Workload Factory discovers existing cache relationships using FlexCache technology, which is NetApp ONTAP's remote caching capability that accelerates data access, reduces WAN latency, bandwidth and costs for read-intensive workloads, especially where clients need to access the same data repeatedly.

.About this task
Link association is required to discover cache relationships.

A cache relationship can exist between volumes on two ONTAP systems such as one FSx for ONTAP file system and one Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. A cache relationship can also exist within a single FSx for ONTAP file system, from volume to volume.

.Before you begin
Consider the following before you begin. 

* You must associate a link to discover cache relationships on a file system. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-fsx-ontap/create-link.html[Learn how to associate an existing link or to create and associate a new link]. After the link associates, return to this operation.
* You must have an existing cache relationship.

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. Select the menu image:workloads-menu-icon.png[The hamburger menu icon is used to navigate to workloads like storage, eda, ai, databases, vmware, and administration.] and then select *Storage*. 
. From the Storage menu, select *FSx for ONTAP*. 
. From *FSx for ONTAP*, select the *Cache relationships* tab. 
. Your cache volumes appear in the table. The table includes the following information about each cache volume:

* *Origin cluster*: The origin, or source, cluster of the FlexCache relationship.
* *Origin volume*: The origin, or source, volume of the FlexCache relationship.
* *Origin storage VM*: The origin, or source, storage VM of the volume.
* *Cache volume*: The cache, or target, volume of the FlexCache relationship.
* *Cache storage VM*: The cache, or target, storage VM of the volume.
* *Status*: The status of the FlexCache relationship. 
* *Available storage on cache*: The amount of available storage on the cache volume.
* *Cache file system*: The file system of the cache volume.
* *Write modes*: The write mode of the FlexCache relationship. 
* *DR cache*: Indicates whether the FlexCache relationship is a disaster recovery (DR) cache. 
* *Export policy*: The export policy of the cache volume.
