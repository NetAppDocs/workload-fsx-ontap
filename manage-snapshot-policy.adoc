Manage snapshot policies for FSx for ONTAP volumes in Workload Factory. A snapshot policy defines how the system creates snapshots for a volume.

.About this task
Snapshot management operations like assigning, changing, and deleting snapshot policies for volumes in an FSx for ONTAP file system are managed at the storage VM level. Snapshot policies can be shared with a single storage VM or with all storage VMs. 

Some management tasks require you to associate a link with the FSx for ONTAP file system. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-fsx-ontap/links-overview.html[Learn about Workload Factory links]. 

By default, every volume is associated with the file system's `default` snapshot policy. We recommend using this policy for most workloads.

== Change a snapshot policy
You can change the snapshot policy name, schedule, and number of copies to retain, and enable or disable immutable snapshots. It isn't possible to enable or disable policy sharing across storage VMs. This option is available only during snapshot policy creation.

.Before you begin
To display existing snapshot policies, you must associate a link. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-fsx-ontap/create-link.html[Learn how to associate an existing link or to create and associate a new link]. After the link associates, return to this operation. 

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. In *Storage*, select *Go to Storage*. 
. In the *FSx for ONTAP* tab, select the three-dot menu of the file system and then select *Manage*. 
. In the file system overview, select the *Storage VMs* tab.
. From the *Storage VMs* tab, select the three-dot menu for the storage VM containing the volume to protect with scheduled snapshots, then *Advanced actions*, and then *Manage snapshot policies*.
. On the Snapshot policy management page, select the three-dot menu for the snapshot policy to change and then select *Edit*.
. In the Edit snapshot policy dialog, make the necessary changes to the snapshot policy.
. Select *Apply*.

.Result
The snapshot policy is updated.

== Enable immutable snapshots
Lock snapshots to prevent them from being deleted during the retention period.

.Before you begin
You must associate a link to enable immutable snapshots. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-fsx-ontap/create-link.html[Learn how to associate an existing link or to create and associate a new link]. After the link associates, return to this operation. 

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. In *Storage*, select *Go to Storage*. 
. In the *FSx for ONTAP* tab, select the three-dot menu of the file system that contains the volume to lock snapshots for and then select *Manage*.  
. In the file system overview, select the *Volumes* tab.
. From the *Volumes* tab, select the three-dot menu for the volume to protect. 
. Select *Data protection actions*, *Snapshots*, then *Make a snapshot immutable*. 
. In the Make a snapshot immutable dialog, do the following: 
.. *Snapshot name*: Select the snapshot to lock.  
.. Set the *Retention period* in number of hours, days, months, or years. 
.. Accept the statement. 
. Select *Apply*. 

.Result
The volume snapshot is now locked.

== Assign a snapshot policy to a volume
You can assign a snapshot policy to a single volume to create scheduled snapshots for the volume. 

.Before you begin
You must associate a link to assign a snapshot policy. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-fsx-ontap/create-link.html[Learn how to associate an existing link or to create and associate a new link]. After the link associates, return to this operation. 

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. In *Storage*, select *Go to Storage*. 
. In the *FSx for ONTAP* tab, select the three-dot menu of the file system that contains the volume to assign a snapshot policy to and then select *Manage*. 
. In the file system overview, select the *Storage VMs* tab.
. From the *Storage VMs* tab, select the three-dot menu for the storage VM containing the volume to protect with scheduled snapshots, then *Advanced actions*, and then *Manage snapshot policies*.
//. In the file system overview, select the *Volumes* tab.
//. From the *Volumes* tab, select the three-dot menu for the volume to protect. 
//. Select *Data protection actions*, *Snapshots*, then *Assign snapshot policy*. 
. On the Snapshot policy management page, select the three-dot menu of the snapshot policy and then select *Assign policy to volume*.
. In the Assign snapshot policy dialog, select a snapshot policy to assign to the volume and review the policy schedule. 
+
If the policy contains immutable snapshots, and you want use it, accept the statement. 
. Select *Assign*. 

.Result
The snapshot policy is assigned to the volume. 

== Remove a snapshot policy from a volume
Remove a snapshot policy from a volume because you no longer want snapshots of the volume or because you want to delete a snapshot policy that is assigned to multiple volumes. To <<Delete a snapshot policy,delete a snapshot policy>> that is assigned to more than one volume, you must manually remove it from all volumes. 

.Before you begin
You must associate a link to remove a snapshot policy. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-fsx-ontap/create-link.html[Learn how to associate an existing link or to create and associate a new link]. After the link associates, return to this operation.  

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. In *Storage*, select *Go to Storage*. 
. In the *FSx for ONTAP* tab, select the three-dot menu of the file system that contains the volume to assign a snapshot policy to and then select *Manage*. 
. In the file system overview, select the *Storage VMs* tab.
. From the *Storage VMs* tab, select the three-dot menu for the storage VM containing the volume to protect with scheduled snapshots, then *Advanced actions*, and then *Manage snapshot policies*.
. On the Snapshot policy management page, select the three-dot menu of the snapshot policy and then select *Assign policy to volume*.
. In the Assign snapshot policy dialog, select *None* to remove the snapshot policy. 
. Select *Assign*. 

.Result
The snapshot policy is removed from the volume. 

== Delete a snapshot policy
Delete a snapshot policy when you no longer need it. 

When a snapshot policy is assigned to more than one volume, you must manually <<Remove a snapshot policy from a volume,remove it>> from all volumes to delete the snapshot policy. Alternatively, you can <<Assign a snapshot policy to a volume,assign a different snapshot policy>> to the volumes. 

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. In *Storage*, select *Go to Storage*. 
. From the Storage menu, select *FSx for ONTAP*. 
. From *FSx for ONTAP*, select the three-dot menu of the file system with the volume and then select *Manage*. 
. In the file system overview, select the *Storage VMs* tab.
. From the *Storage VMs* tab, select the three-dot menu of the storage VM with the snapshot policy to delete, then *Advanced actions*, and then *Manage snapshot policies*.
. On the Snapshot policy management page, select the three-dot menu for the snapshot policy to delete and then select *Delete*.
. In the Delete dialog, select *Delete* to delete the policy.
