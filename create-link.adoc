= Connect to an FSx for ONTAP file system with a Lambda link
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ./media/

[.lead]
To perform advanced ONTAP management operations, set up a connection between your workload factory account and one or more FSx for ONTAP file systems. This involves associating new and existing Lambda links, and authenticating the links. Link association lets you monitor and manage certain features directly from the FSx for ONTAP file system that are unavailable through the Amazon FSx for ONTAP API.

.About this task

Links leverage AWS Lambda to execute code in response to events and automatically manage the computing resources required by that code. The links that you create are part of your NetApp account and they are associated with an AWS account.

You can create a link in your account when defining an FSx for ONTAP file system. The link is used for that file system, and it can be used for other FSx for ONTAP file systems. You can also associate a link for a file system later. 

Links require authentication. You can authenticate links using credentials stored in the workload factory credentials service or with your credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager. Only one authentication method is supported per link. For example, if you select link authentication with AWS Secrets Manager, you can't change the authentication method later.

NOTE: AWS Secrets Manager isn't supported when using a Connector.

== Associate a new link
Associating a new link includes link creation and association. 

You have two options for creating links in this workflow - automatically or manually. You'll need to launch an AWS CloudFormation stack in your AWS account to create the link. 

* Automatically: Creates a link with automatic registration via workload factory. This requires tokens for workload factory automation and the CloudFormation code is short-lived and usable for up to six hours. 
* Manually: Creates a link with manual registration. The CloudFormation code persists giving you more time to complete the operation. This is useful when working with different teams like Security and DevOps that might first need to grant the permissions necessary to complete link creation.

.Before you begin
* You should consider which link creation option you'll use. 
* You need to have at least one FSx for ONTAP file system in workload factory. To discover or create FSx for ONTAP file systems, you must have an AWS account with permissions for FSx for ONTAP instances and link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/add-credentials.html#overview[add credentials in workload factory^] with _read-only_ or _read/write_ permissions for Storage management. 
* The following ports must be open in the security group associated with the FSx for ONTAP file system for link connectivity. 
** For the workload factory console: port 443 (HTTPS)
** For CloudShell: port 22(SSH)
* You must have the following permissions in your AWS account when adding a link using a CloudFormation stack:

.Create automatically
--
Use CloudFormation to automatically create and register the link within workload factory. 

.Steps

. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. In Storage, select *Go to storage inventory*. 
. In the *FSx for ONTAP* tab, select the three-dot menu of the file system to associate a link to and then select *Associate link*. 
. In the Associate link dialog, select *Create a new link* and select *Continue*.
. On the Create Link page, provide the following: 
.. *Link name*: Enter the name that you want to use for this link. The name must be unique within your account.
.. *AWS Secrets Manager*: Optional. Allows workload factory to fetch FSx for ONTAP access credentials from your AWS Secrets Manager. 
+
The link deployment stack automatically adds the following default secret manager ARN regex to the Lambda permission policy: `arn:aws:secretsmanager:<link_deployment_region>:<link_deployment_account_id>:secret:FSxSecret*`. 
+
You can either create secrets in alignment with the default permissions or assign your custom permissions for the link policy.
+
*Configure VPC private endpoint to AWS Secrets Manager* is disabled by default. Selecting this option stores the secret using the VPC private endpoint instead of storing it locally.
.. *Link permissions*: Select one of the following options for link permissions:

* *Automatic*: Select this option so that AWS CloudFormation code automatically creates the Lambda permission policy and execution role. 
* *User-provided*: Select this option to assign a specified Lambda execution role and its attached policies to the Lambda link. The following permissions are required for the Lambda permission policy. The `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission is required only if you enabled AWS Secrets Manager.
+
[source,json]
"ec2:CreateNetworkInterface",
"ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces",
"ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface",
"ec2:AssignPrivateIpAddresses",
"ec2:UnassignPrivateIpAddresses",
"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
+
Enter the Lambda execution role ARN in the text box.
.. *Tags*: Optionally, add any tags that you want to associate with this link so you can more easily categorize your resources. For example, you could add a tag that identifies this link as being used by FSx for ONTAP file systems.
+
Workload factory automatically retrieves the AWS account, location, and security group based on the FSx for ONTAP file system.
. Select *Create*. 
+
The Redirect to CloudFormation dialog appears and explains how to create the link from the AWS CloudFormation service.
. Select *Continue* to open the AWS Management Console, and then log in to the AWS account for this FSx for ONTAP file system.
. On the Quick create stack page, under Capabilities, select *I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources*.
+
Note that three permissions are granted to Lambda when you launch the CloudFormation template. Workload factory uses these permissions when using links.
+
[source,json]
"lambda:InvokeFunction",
"lambda:GetFunction",
"lambda:UpdateFunctionCode"

. Select *Create stack* and then Select *Continue*.
+
You can monitor the link creation status on the Events page. This should take no more than 5 minutes.
. Return to the workload factory interface and you'll see that the link is associated with the FSx for ONTAP file system.

.Result

Workload factory associates the link with the FSx for ONTAP file system. You can perform advanced ONTAP operations. 

== Associate an existing link with an FSx for ONTAP file system
After you create a link, associate it with one or more FSx for ONTAP file system.

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. In Storage, select *Go to storage inventory*. 
. In the *FSx for ONTAP* tab, select the three-dot menu of the file system to associate a link to and then select *Associate link*. 
. In the Associate link page, select *Associate an existing link*, select the link, and select *Continue*.
. Select the authentication mode. 
* Workload Factory: enter the password twice. 
* AWS Secrets Manager: enter the secret ARN.

Ensure the secret ARN contains the following key valid pairs:

** filesystemID = FSx_filesystem_id
** user = FSx_user
** password = user_password
+
NOTE: Authentication with AWS Secrets Manager requires that you set the _user_ to `fsxadmin` or another user that was created on the FSx for ONTAP file system.

. Select *Apply*. 


.Result

The link is associated with the FSx for ONTAP file system. You can perform advanced ONTAP operations.


== Troubleshoot issues with AWS Secrets Manager link authentication

Issue::: The link lacks permissions to retrieve the secret.
+
*Resolution*: Add permissions after the link is active. Log in to the AWS console, locate the Lambda link, and edit the attached permission policy.

Issue::: The secret isn't found.
+
*Resolution*: Provide the correct secret ARN.

Issue::: The secret isn't in the right format.
+
*Resolution*: Go to AWS Secrets Manager and edit the format.
+
The secret should contain the following key valid pairs:

* filesystemID = FSx_filesystem_id
* username = FSx_user
* password = user_password

Issue::: The secret doesn't contain valid ONTAP credentials for file system authentication. 
+
*Resolution*: Provide credentials that can authenticate FSx for ONTAP file systems in AWS Secrets Manager.
