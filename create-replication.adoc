[.lead]
Create a replication relationship for an FSx for ONTAP file system in NetApp Workload Factory to avoid data loss in case of an unforeseen disaster. Replication is supported between two FSx for ONTAP file systems, and between Cloud Volumes ONTAP or an on-premises ONTAP system and an FSx for ONTAP file system.

.About this task
Replication adds protection against data loss if the region where your data resides experiences a disaster. 

This operation creates a replication relationship for source volumes in an FSx for ONTAP file system, on-premises ONTAP system, or Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. 

Replicated volumes in the target file system are data protection (DP) volumes and follow the naming format: `{OriginalVolumeName}_copy`.

When you replicate a source volume with immutable files, the target volume and file system stay locked until the retention period of the immutable files in the source volume ends. The immutable files feature is available when you link:create-volume.html[create a volume] for an FSx for ONTAP file system. 

[NOTE]
===============================
* Replication isn't supported for block volumes using iSCSI or NVMe protocols.
* You can replicate one source (read/write) volume or one data protection (DP) volume. Cascading replication is supported, but a third hop isn't. Learn more about link:https://review.docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-fsx-ontap_cascade-replication/cascade-replication.html[cascading replication^].
===============================

.Before you begin
Consider the following before you begin.

* You must have one FSx for ONTAP file system to use for the target in the replication relationship.
* The FSx for ONTAP file system you use for the replication relationship must have an associated link. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-fsx-ontap/create-link.html[Learn how to associate an existing link or to create and associate a new link]. After you associate the link, return to this operation.
* For replication from an on-premises ONTAP system to an FSx for ONTAP file system, make sure you have discovered the on-premises ONTAP system. 

Follow these steps to replicate specific or all volumes in a file system.

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. Select the menu image:workloads-menu-icon.png[The hamburger menu icon is used to navigate to workloads like storage, eda, ai, databases, vmware, and administration.] and then select *Storage*.
. From the Storage menu, select *FSx for ONTAP*. 
. From *FSx for ONTAP*, select the actions menu of the file system that contains the volume(s) to replicate and then select *Manage*.
. Either replicate all volumes in a file system or replicate select volumes. 
* To replicate all volumes in a file system: From the file system overview, select *Replicate data*.
* To replicate select volumes: From the file system overview, select the *Volumes* tab.
+
In the Volumes table, select one or more volumes and then select *Replicate data*. 
. On the Replicate data page, under Replication target, provide the following: 
include::_include/create-replication.adoc[]
//Referenced in repo: bluexp-fsx-ontap in file: use/task-manage-working-environment.adoc

[start=8]
//Rachel L: Added a hack to make the last step have a numbered step in the right order.
. Select *Create*. 

.Result
The replication relationship appears in the *Replication relationships* tab in the target FSx for ONTAP file system.
