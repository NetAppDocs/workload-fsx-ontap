Create a replication relationship for an FSx for ONTAP file system in BlueXP workload factory to avoid data loss in case of an unforeseen disaster.

.About this task
Replication is an added layer of data protection which is essential in case the region where your data resides experiences a disaster. Data loss can be avoided if you use cross-region replication. 

This operation creates a replication relationship for one or all source volumes in an FSx for ONTAP file system. 

Replicated volumes in the target file system are data protection (DP) volumes and follow the naming format: `{OriginalVolumeName}_copy`.

When replicating a source volume with immutable files, the target volume and file system  become locked until the retention period of the immutable files in the source volume ends. The immutable files feature is available when you link:create-volume.html[create a volume] for an FSx for ONTAP file system. 

.Before you begin
Make sure you meet the following prerequisites before you begin. 

* You must have two available file systems in your storage inventory to create a replication relationship.
* The two file systems you use for the replication relationship must have an associated link. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-fsx-ontap/create-link.html[Learn how to associate an existing link or to create and associate a new link]. After the link associates, return to this operation. 

Complete the following steps to replicate select volumes or replicate all volumes in a file system. 

You can replicate one source (read/write) volume or one data protection (DP) volume. Cascading replication is supported, but a third hop isn't. Learn more about link:https://review.docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-fsx-ontap_cascade-replication/cascade-replication.html[cascading replication^]. 

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. In Storage, select *Go to storage inventory*. 
. In the *FSx for ONTAP* tab, select the three-dot menu of the file system that contains the volume(s) to replicate and then select *Manage*.
. Either replicate all volumes in a file system or replicate select volumes. 
* To replicate all volumes in a file system: From the file system overview, select *Replicate data*.
* To replicate select volumes: From the file system overview, select the *Volumes* tab.
+
In the Volumes table, select one or more volumes and then select *Replicate data*. 
. On the Replicate data page, under Replication target, provide the following: 

//Referenced in repo: bluexp-fsx-ontap in file: use/task-manage-working-environment.adoc
include::_include/create-replication.adoc[]

.Result
The replication relationship appears in the *Replication relationships* tab in the target FSx for ONTAP file system.
