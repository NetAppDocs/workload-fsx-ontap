Explore savings for your storage workloads which use AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic File System (EFS), and FSx for Windows File Server against FSx for NetApp ONTAP. 

== About this task
Workload Factory provides a storage calculator so you can compare the costs of storage on FSx for ONTAP file systems against Elastic Block Store (EBS),Elastic File System (EFS), and FSx for Windows File Server storage. Depending on your storage requirements, you might find that FSx for ONTAP file systems are the most cost effective for you.

You can explore savings for a specific storage system or for specific volumes using the storage calculator. The storage calculator displays whether the storage for the workloads on these storage systems would cost less if you used an FSx for ONTAP file system.

If Workload Factory determines that you could save money by running these workloads on an FSx for ONTAP file system, you can deploy the file system from the calculator directly from Workload Factory. In some cases, Workload Factory may recommend that you deploy multiple file systems based on the amount of storage you are currently using, and based on the performance characteristics of your workloads.

== Provide your system requirements

If you have enabled _automate_ mode (link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/operational-modes.html[learn more about modes]) by adding AWS credentials to your Workload Factory account, then Workload Factory can identify all the storage systems that are available in your AWS account and display the characteristics of the volumes on those systems in the Storage inventory page. The AWS account that is searched is based on the credentials you've defined in your Workload Factory account.
//add _read_ mode above when it is supported

This figure shows the volumes on FSx for Windows File Server systems that have been discovered in an AWS account.

If you haven't added credentials to link your Workload Factory account with an AWS account (called _basic_ mode), you can manually enter the characteristics required for a storage system you are planning to deploy and the storage calculator will determine the best file system based on cost. You can use this method to scope a new FSx for ONTAP file system while using _automate_ mode as well.

This figure shows the storage calculator page with a comparison between FSx for ONTAP and EBS storage.

== Before you begin
For Workload Factory to detect AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic File System (EFS), and FSx for Windows File Server storage environments in your AWS account, make sure you link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/add-credentials.html[grant _automate_ permissions^] in your AWS account.

After you provide details for your storage system configuration, review the calculations and recommendations provided on the page. 

Additionally, scroll down to the bottom of the page to *Export PDF* or *View the calculations*.

== Deploy FSx for ONTAP file systems
If you'd like to switch to FSx for ONTAP to realize cost savings, click *Create* to create the file system(s) directly from the Create an FSx for ONTAP file system wizard or click *Save* to save the recommended configuration(s) for later. 

=== Deployment methods
In _automate_ mode, you can deploy the FSx for ONTAP file system directly from Workload Factory. You can also copy the content from the Codebox window and deploy the system using one of the Codebox methods.

In  _basic_ mode, you can copy the content from the Codebox window and deploy the FSx for ONTAP file system using one of the Codebox methods.
