You can update certain immutable files settings for a volume when the feature is enabled, such as the retention policy and periods, the autocommit period, and volume append mode.

//add privileged delete when feature is available

Note that enabling immutable files is only possible during link:create-volume.html[volume creation].

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. In Storage, select *Go to Storage*.  
. From the Storage menu, select *FSx for ONTAP*. 
. From *FSx for ONTAP*, select the three-dot menu of the file system with the volume to update and then select *Manage*. 
. In the Volumes tab, select the three-dot menu of the volume to clone. 
. Select *Data protection actions*, then *Manage immutable files*.
. On the Manage Immutable files page, you can update the following:  
* *Retention period*: select *Unspecified* or *Specify period*. 
+
** *Unspecified*: The default minimum period is "0" years and the default maximum period is "30 years".
** *Specify period*: Option to define the retention policy, minimum and maximum periods, the autocommit feature, and the volume append mode feature. Provide the following details: 
*** *Retention policy*: This period must be greater than or equal to the minimum retention period and less than or equal to the maximum retention period. 
*** *Minimum and maximum periods*: Set the minimum and maximum periods to commit files in this volume to an immutable WORM state. 
* *Autocommit*: enable or disable the feature to automatically commit files to WORM that haven't been modified during the Autocommit period.
//* *Privileged delete*: enable or disable the feature. Enabling the feature allows a SnapLock administrator to delete an unexpired WORM volume. This feature is only supported in Enterprise retention mode. 
* *Volume append mode*: enable or disable the feature. Enabling volume append mode enables you to add new content to WORM files. 
. Click *Apply*. 

//Future update:
//If users can enable or disable the immutable files feature from this workflow, use the following lead: 
//Make your files permanently immutable with the immutable files feature. This feature prevents files from being accidentally or maliciously deleted or modified. 
//.About this task
//Enabling the immutable files feature permanently commits files in this volume to an immutable WORM (write-once-read-many) state. 
//Enabling this feature is possible only during volume creation. 
//Once enabled, this feature cannot be disabled. 
//Retention modes:::
//You can select from two retention modes - Enterprise or Compliance. 
//* In Enterprise mode, an immutable files, or SnapLock, administrator can delete a file during its retention period. 
//* In Compliance mode, a WORM file cannot be deleted before its retention period expires. Similarly, the immutable volume cannot be deleted until the retention periods for all files within the volume expire. 
//Autocommit:::
//You'll have the option to enable the autocommit feature. The autocommit feature commits a file to WORM state on a SnapLock volume if the file did not change for the autocommit period duration. The autocommit feature is disabled by default. The files you want to autocommit must reside on a SnapLock volume.
//== Enable the immutable files feature
//Follow the steps to enable the immutable files features for any volume. 
//.Before you begin
//Consider the retention mode and retention period for the files in the volume before you begin. 
//.Steps
//. Log in to the link:https://console.workloads.netapp.com/[Workload Factory console^]. 
//. In Storage, select *Go to Storage*. 
//. Select the *Volumes* tab. 
//. In the Volumes tab, select the three-dot menu of the volume to clone. 
//. Select *Data protection actions*, then *Manage immutable files*. 
//. Enable the immutable files feature. 
//. Click *Apply*. 
//. In the Enable immutable files dialog, read and accept the notice. 
//. Click *Enable*. 
//. On the Manage Immutable files page, enable *Immutable files powered by SnapLock*. 
//. Under *Retention mode*, select *Enterprise* or *Compliance*. 
//. Under *Retention period*, select *Unspecified* or *Specify period*. 
//+
//Unspecified: The default minimum period is "0" years and the default maximum period is "30 years". 
//. If you selected *Specify period*, provide the following details: 
//.. *Retention period*: This period must be greater than or equal to the minimum retention period and less than or equal to the maximum retention period. 
//.. *Minimum and maximum periods*: Set the minimum and maximum periods to commit files in this volume to an immutable WORM state. 
//. Under *Autocommit*, enable or disable the feature to automatically commit files to WORM that haven't been modified during the Autocommit period. 
//. Under *Privileged delete*, enable or disable the feature. Enabling the feature allows a SnapLock administrator to delete an unexpired WORM volume. This feature is only supported in Enterprise retention mode. 
//. Under *Volume append mode*, enable or disable the feature. Enabling volume append mode enables you to add new content to WORM files. 
//. Click *Apply*. 

// Disabling the feature is currently unavailable. Add if it becomes available. - Rachel Lithman

//== Disable the immutable files feature
//Disabling immutable files allows volumes to be modified or deleted.

//Follow the steps to disable the immutable files features for any volume. 
//.Steps
//. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
//. In Storage, select *Go to Storage*. 
//. Select the *Volumes* tab. 
//. In the Volumes tab, select the three-dot menu of the volume to clone. 
//. Select *Data protection actions*, then *Manage immutable files*. 
//. Disable *Immutable files powered by SnapLock*.
//. In the Disable immutable files dialog, read and accept the statement. 
//. Click *Disable*.
//. On the Manage immutable files page, click *Apply*. 

.Result
The updates now apply to the volume.
