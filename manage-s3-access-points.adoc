Manage the S3 access points for a volume in NetApp Workload Factory. You can use the Workload Factory console to assign S3 access points to existing volumes, view details for your S3 buckets, make changes to existing access points, or delete S3 access points. 

.About this task
Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP supports S3 data access to NFS and SMB file systems, enabling their integration with dozens of S3-based AWS services such as Amazon Bedrock, SageMaker, Athena, AWS Glue, and more. You can connect AWS services to all of your object storage data.

By attaching S3 access points to NFS and SMB volumes in an FSx for ONTAP file system, files stored in these volumes can be accessed by any AWS services as if they were in an S3 bucket. When attaching the access point, you define its unique id, specify the file access type (UNIX or Windows) and add a username for authorizing file access requests by the access point. 

After the S3 access point is attached, it appears in the AWS Management Console and has a unique access point alias. This alias is used as the S3 bucket name provided to the AWS services to which you want to connect. For example, you can provide the alias to an Amazon Bedrock knowledge base, and it will then use the files in the FSx for ONTAP volume to provide contextual answers to queries.

You can attach multiple S3 access points to a single FSx for ONTAP volume, each with its own unique access level, allowing you to connect to as many AWS services as required.

.Before you begin
You must have an existing volume with an S3 access point.

== Create and attach S3 access points to an existing volume

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. Select the menu image:workloads-menu-icon.png[The hamburger menu icon is used to navigate to workloads like storage, eda, ai, databases, vmware, and administration.] and then select *Storage*.
. From the Storage menu, select *FSx for ONTAP*.
. From *FSx for ONTAP*, select the file system with the volume to update.
. From the file system overview, select the *Volumes* tab.
. From the Volumes tab, select the actions menu for the volume to manage the S3 access points for and then select *Advanced actions*, then *Manage S3 access points*.
. Select *Create and attach S3 access point*. 
. In the *Create and attach S3 access point* dialog, provide the following information:
+
* *S3 access point name*: Enter the name of the S3 access point.
* *User*: Select an existing user with access to the volume or create a new user.
* *User type*: Select *UNIX* or *Windows* as the user type.
* *Enable metadata catalog*: Select to enable metadata on the volume to generate metadata inventory for all objects accessible to the S3 access point. This feature incurs AWS costs for S3 requests. 
. Select *Create and attach*. 

== View details 
Alias, ARN, and S3 URI are available access point details without metadata enabled. 

With metadata enabled on the volume, you can view access point, inventory table, and table bucket details of existing S3 access points attached to the volume. A link to the inventory table in the AWS Management Console is also provided.

Access point details are copiable for use in other applications.
