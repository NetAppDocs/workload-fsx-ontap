In NetApp Workload Factory, you can update the storage efficiency setting after volume creation. 

.About this task
The storage efficiency feature includes deduplication, data compression, and data compaction to achieve optimal space savings on a FlexVol volume. Deduplication eliminates duplicate data blocks. Data compression compresses the data blocks to reduce the amount of physical storage that is required. Data compaction stores more data in less space to increase storage efficiency. 

If you chose not to enable storage efficiency when you created a volume, you can enable the setting for potential space and cost savings at any time. 

Volumes use thin provisioning whether you enable or disable storage efficiency.
