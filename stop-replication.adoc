Stop a replication relationship between source and target volumes. 

== About this task
When you stop a replication, scheduled replication updates from the source volume to the target volume pause. The target volume transitions from read-only to read-write. Both volumes continue to share the latest replication snapshot as a new baseline for later resynchronization.

== Before you begin
You can't stop a replication relationship when the status is â€¦.? 

.Steps
. Go to the Workload Factory console. 
. In Storage, select *Go to storage inventory*. 
. In Storage, select the *Replication relationships* tab. 
. Click the three dots menu of the replication relationship to stop. 
. Select *Break*. 
. In the Break replication dialog, select *Break*.

The replication status of the volume changes to *Broken*. The target volume becomes writable.
