=== Home page includes well-architected issues for Storage

The NetApp Workload Factory home page includes a Focus tile where well-architected issues appear for your workloads. From there, you can navigate to the Storage Well-Architected screen to view the well-architected status of all FSx for ONTAP file systems in your storage environment and remediate issues.

=== S3 bucket details available in Storage

With NetApp Workload Factory, you can schedule automatic scanning of your AWS S3 buckets and populate S3 tables to give you a clear snapshot of all objects, their metadata, attributes, and tags. Access to these details helps you maintain control, visibility, and trust in the data you're responsible for, while reducing operational overhead.
