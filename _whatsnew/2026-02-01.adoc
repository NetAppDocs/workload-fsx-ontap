=== S3 access point enhancements in Storage
Several enhancements have been made to the S3 access point management capabilities in the Storage workload for NetApp Workload Factory. You can input network configuration details for your S3 access points and add S3 access point tags. Additional enhancements include the ability to view S3 bucket details and perform more actions for managing S3 access points.

==== S3 bucket details available in Storage

With NetApp Workload Factory, you can schedule automatic scanning of your AWS S3 buckets and populate S3 tables to give you a clear snapshot of all objects, their metadata, attributes, and tags. Access to these details helps you maintain control, visibility, and trust in the data you're responsible for, while reducing operational overhead.

=== Well-architected analysis updates

Workload Factory analyzes your FSx for ONTAP file systems for the following configurations: 

* Optimize cache volume size: checks whether volume autosize and scrubbing are enabled on cache volumes to maintain optimal size and focus the cache on hot data for peak efficiency.
* Orphaned block devices: recommends archiving block device data or deleting a block device if it hasn't been used for seven consecutive days.
* Storage VM logical reporting: checks whether the default reporting setting for a storage VM is set to logical which provides better visibility into storage usage at the volume level.
