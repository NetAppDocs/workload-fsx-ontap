=== Mount command available 
Mount commands are now available for NFS and CIFS access to a volume. You can get the mount point for a volume within an FSx for ONTAP file system by selecting *Basic actions* then *View mount command*.

=== Update storage efficiency after volume creation
You can now enable or disable storage efficiency for FlexVol volumes after volume creation. Storage efficiency includes the following features: deduplication, data compression, and data compaction. Enabling storage efficiency helps you achieve optimal space savings on a FlexVol volume.

=== On-premises detection and replication
On-premises storage environment detection and replication are now possible in BlueXP workload factory. Once an on-premises ONTAP cluster is detected, you can replicate data from the on-premises cluster to an FSx for ONTAP file system. All on-premises workflows are found in the new *On-Premises ONTAP* tab in the Storage inventory.

=== AWS credentials improve savings calculator analysis
You now have the option to add AWS credentials from the savings calculator. Doing so improves the accuracy of the savings calculator analysis of your Amazon Elastic Block Store, Elastic File Systems, and FSx for Windows File Server storage environments when compared with FSx for ONTAP.

=== Amazon Systems Manager Agent link support
Additional link support includes AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM) which you can use to execute code in response to events and automatically manage the computing resources required by that code. Associate existing SSM links with an FSx for ONTAP file system to utilize advanced ONTAP operations.
