=== AWS credentials improve savings calculator analysis
You now have the option to add AWS credentials from the savings calculator. Doing so improves the accuracy of the savings calculator analysis of your Amazon Elastic Block Store, Elastic File Systems, and FSx for Windows File Server storage environments when compared with FSx for ONTAP.

=== Amazon Systems Manager Agent link support
Additional link support includes AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM) which you can use to execute code in response to events and automatically manage the computing resources required by that code. Associate existing SSM links with an FSx for ONTAP file system to utilize advanced ONTAP operations.
