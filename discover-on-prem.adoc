[.lead]
Discover an on-premise ONTAP cluster in BlueXP workload factory so that you can replicate the data to an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system. 

.About this task

.Before you begin
Make sure you have the following before you begin: 

* An FSx for ONTAP file system for replication.
* A connected link to associate with the discovered on-premises cluster. If you don't have a link, you'll need to link:create-link.html[create one]. 
* ONTAP user credentials with required permissions. 
* On-premises ONTAP version 9.8 and above.
* Connectivity as shown in the following diagram.

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. In Storage, select *Go to storage inventory*. 
. Select the *On-premises ONTAP* tab.
. Select *Discover*. 
. Review the prerequisites and select *Next*. 
. On the Discover ONTAP on-premises page, provide the following under *Cluster configuration*:
.. *Link*: Select a link. The link will be associated with the FSx for ONTAP file system and to create connectivity between your on-premises cluster and the file system. 
+
If you haven't created a link, follow the instructions and then return to this operation and select the link.
.. *Cluster IP address*: Provide the IP address for the on-premises ONTAP cluster to replicate. 
.. *ONTAP credentials*: Enter the ONTAP credentials for the on-premises ONTAP cluster. Make sure the user has the required permissions. 
. Select *Discover* to start the discovery process. 

.Result
The on-premises ONTAP cluster has been discovered and now appears in the *On-Premises ONTAP* tab. 

You can now view the data in your on-premises ONTAP cluster and replicate the data to an FSx for ONTAP file system.
